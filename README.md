# EAT-DA-BURGER APP

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate knowledge in using handlebars using express and mysql also to understand how to deploy a website
using Heroku.

There will be a list of current "burgers" from mysql table created when using the devour button a "burger" will be sent to the devoured 
section of the page.

To add a burger you will need to enter text into the input field with the name of your desired "burger" then select whether this "burger"
has been devoured or not after you will add the "burger" and based on your selection the "burger" will be added onto the appropriate
section of the page.

Here is the link for the deployed page using Heroku:
